Minesweeper
===========

A sample C# console game. This was hacked up over a few hours, and I ditched TDD toward the end, so I am a bad person.

To run the game, pass the number of rows, number of columns, and number of bombs. For example, to play a standard minesweeper game, use:

>Minesweeper 9 9 10
